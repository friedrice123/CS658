# CS658: Topics in Malware Analysis - Group 8
This is our final submission of the preliminary results obtained on the CICEV2023 Dataset for the task of Binary Classification of Attack vs Benign Configurations in Electric Vehicle Systems. You can look into the report submitted along with this for a better analysis of the dataset and how the data was processed for the given problem. 
To generate the data, the following Python scripts were used along with some manipulation of CSV files for combining them. To run the code, simply use cs658-project.ipynb file.
* cs658-project.ipynb contains the code for the proposed model and the processing of the data done on the given dataset
* Raw_Data_Directory_Tree.txt: Contains the directory tree structure for the Raw Data that has been used for our analysis
* Processed_Data_Directory_Tree.txt: Contains the directory tree structure for the Processed Data that has been used for our analysis
* stat_csv_creator.py: Used to create the CSV files for STAT.json type of data found across all combinations of data
* top_csv_creator.py: Used to create the CSV files for TOP.json type of data found across all combinations of data
* time_diff_csv_creator.py: Used to create the CSV files for TIME_DELTA.json type of data found across all combinations of data
* top_clean.py: Create balance in the attack and normal scenarios in TOP data used
* combined_csv_creator.py: Used to create the CSV files for combination of TOP, STAT, TIME_DELTA type of data found across all combinations of data
* combine.py: Combine all csv filed generated by combined_csv_creator.py
